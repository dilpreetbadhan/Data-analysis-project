 # Kaggle 2023 Developer Survey Analysis

## Overview
This project is part of the **IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project** offered by **Coursera**. The goal is to analyze the Kaggle 2023 Developer Survey dataset using **IBM Cognos Analytics** to identify current and future trends in technology, particularly focusing on programming languages, databases, and developer demographics. The project involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and the creation of interactive dashboards to extract actionable insights.
